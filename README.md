# l0ve.stream

A place for the creating, sharing and listing to playlists of music.

Playlists are the sharing of feelings. They are an outreached hand,
inviting you into the affective atmospheric of the friend or love one.
Come join us. Be with us. This is how I was feeling, this is the journey i was on.
This is what I want you to feel to, to be here with me, with us. 

**This is a work in progress.**
